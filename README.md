# Doma Real-time Domain Event Feed

This project will track and display live domain events from the Doma Protocol including tokenizations, transfers, and bridges. 
It will be a transparent, real-time activity feed for users and builders in the DomainFi ecosystem.

The project is currently pending API key access from Doma for further development.
